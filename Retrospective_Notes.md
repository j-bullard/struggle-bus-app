# Retospective Notes

## Planning

### Successes

- The planning board was built out in depth, aligning well with the project's development direction.
- Wire Frames were developed to contain sufficient information.

### Struggles

- Difining what our project should cover and the scoop.
- Project file restructuiring happened frequently.
- Velocity with such a large team with differeing levels of expertise.
- A lot of ideas were suggested that we had to choose from and decide which ones to tackle.

## Execution

### Successes

- Chakra is great
- We made an App that looks and works like a charm given the limited time that was alloted to the team
- Team based approach allowed productivity and learning to take place concurrently

### Struggles

- CRA is horrible and outdated!!
- Introduction of new directories/extensions added additional syntax for Components, import statements, and functions to work properly.
- Write tests before or not at all. It was difficult to write tests after the component was created. Spent too much time getting the test to work than actually writing the component.
- New API can always present issues; good example of how much time you can lose trying to understand how a different API performs within your planning.
